  <p>What would Science, Technology and Innovation look like in a world not driven by the endless pursuit of economic growth? What exciting futures would begin to take shape if we harnessed technological and scientific advances for something other than growth alone? What new worlds might we be able to conceive if human wellbeing and the natural environment were the primary focus of innovation?</p><p>Here at the Post-Growth Innovation Lab, these questions lie at the heart of our work. Our research strives to address the important dilemmas that face Science, Technology and Innovation within the context of a post-growth world. Innovating without growth means using interdisciplinary thinking to reimagine a new future: a future sensitive to the needs of the different stakeholders who will inhabit it, and able to address the economic, ecological, sociopolitical, and gender-based inequalities that affect us all.</p>
